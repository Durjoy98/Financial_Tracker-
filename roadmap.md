# Financial Tracker App - Roadmap

## 1. Project Overview
The Financial Tracker App is a Python-based application that helps users:
- Log daily expenses
- Track spending by category
- Stay within a budget with real-time updates

The app will be built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and feature a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## 3. Development Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Planning & Design**
- [ ] Define app features and functionalities
- [ ] Design class structure using OOP principles
- [ ] Choose appropriate GUI framework
- [ ] Plan database schema for expense tracking

### **Phase 2: Core Application Development**
#### Backend Development:
- [ ] Implement User class (authentication, profiles, settings)
- [ ] Implement Expense class (amount, category, date, description)
- [ ] Implement Budget class (limits, warnings, remaining balance calculations)
- [ ] Implement DatabaseHandler class for CRUD operations

#### GUI Development:
- [ ] Design and implement main dashboard UI
- [ ] Implement expense logging form
- [ ] Implement category-wise expense tracking view
- [ ] Implement budget tracking with real-time updates

### **Phase 3: Data Processing & Reporting**
- [ ] Integrate data visualization (charts, graphs for spending analysis)
- [ ] Implement filters for date range, categories, and spending trends
- [ ] Generate monthly and yearly financial reports

### **Phase 4: Testing & Debugging**
- [ ] Unit tests for core classes and database operations
- [ ] GUI testing for usability and responsiveness
- [ ] Debug and optimize performance

### **Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation**
- [ ] Package the application as an executable
- [ ] Write user documentation and help guides
- [ ] Publish the project on GitHub with a README
- [ ] Deploy (if applicable) as a web app or standalone application
